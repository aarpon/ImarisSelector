ImarisSelector
==============

ImarisSelector allows users to pick the module licenses to check out when Imaris starts.

Moreover, the administrator backend allows fine tuning of which modules are visible to the
user and also allows forcing several user settings (like data cache file paths, Imaris XT
paths, and more) that are otherwise responsibility of the user to set. This is very handy
if an administrator is in charge of maintaining several Imaris installations in a facility.
